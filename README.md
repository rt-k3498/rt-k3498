# 👋 Hi, I'm Arty

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building systems that actually work under pressure — from clean front-ends to resilient back-ends, from infrastructure to machine learning experiments.

I care about fundamentals, clarity, and shipping things that don’t collapse the moment real users show up.

## 🧠 What I Work On

- Full-stack web applications with modern frontend and backend architectures  
- Scalable APIs and distributed systems  
- Machine learning pipelines, experiments, and model evaluation  
- Cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and DevOps automation  
- Algorithms, data structures, and performance-critical code  

I like projects where design decisions matter and trade-offs are unavoidable.

## 📈 How I Think About Engineering

- Prefer simple systems that are easy to reason about
- Measure before optimizing
- Care about correctness before cleverness
- Learn fundamentals deeply, then apply them broadly

I’m especially interested in the intersection of **software engineering, machine learning, and systems design**.
